# Monte-Carlo - Lattice pricing application
This repo contains options, models and tests that I used to extend the WBS training course. For copyright reasons, the repo with that source code is private and I have not included it in this repo, however, the link to that repo can be made available if neccesary to see the full working code.
Descriptions of each folder will be given below.
