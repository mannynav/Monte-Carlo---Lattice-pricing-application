# Monte Carlo and Lattice pricing application
This repo contains options, models and tests that I implemented to extend the WBS training course. For copyright reasons, the repo with that source code is private and I have not included code I did not write, however, the link to that repo can be made available if neccesary to see the full working code. The models and some of the options will also be implemented in my other repo "Multithreaded Monte Carlo" which is publicly available. For this repo, the files will be put into Options, Models or Tests folders, descriptions of each are shown below.
